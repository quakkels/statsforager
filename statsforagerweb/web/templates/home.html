		<h1>Web Analytics Solutions for the Independent Website</h1>
		<p>
			We have great tools that help you run your website. Know when your latest post strikes a chord in your audience, or gets tons of search engine traction.
			StatsForager lets you make informed decisions as you manage your website's content and marketing. No one wants to run their website blind,
			and with big players like Google Web Analytics and Google Tag Manager treating independent websites as just a funnel for their own advertising at best, 
			and at worst as	an inconvenience, StatsForager is here to give you insights into your website traffic without sharing your site's data.
